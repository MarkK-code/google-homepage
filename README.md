Google homepage

Mini project to mockup google homepage without its functionality.
Its mostly aimed at html and css practice, here I show I am able to deconstruct one of the most famous webpage and recreate its design. For this mini project developer tools were used in case of checking similarity of original and my work.

This project was done for The Odin Project.
